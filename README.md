# Sign-EMAILCertificate
Signing Email Certificate using python and smail
Sign-EMAILCertificate is a Python project designed to simplify the process of sending signed emails using OpenSSL, the Python programming language, and the smail library. This project provides a convenient and straightforward way to generate private keys, certificate signing requests (CSR), and certificates using OpenSSL, and then utilize them to send signed emails via an SMTP server.

Features:

Private Key, CSR, and Certificate Generation: The project leverages the OpenSSL library to generate a private key (private_key.pem), a certificate signing request (csr.pem), and a certificate (certificate.pem). These cryptographic components form the foundation for signing emails and ensuring their authenticity.

Email Signing: The project facilitates the signing of emails using the generated private key and certificate. This process adds a digital signature to the email, providing recipients with assurance of the message's integrity and origin.

SMTP Email Delivery: Using the smail library, the project connects to an SMTP server and delivers the signed email to the recipient's inbox. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is the standard protocol for sending emails over the internet, ensuring reliable and efficient delivery.
